# Country-State-City-database

Do you need a dataset which contains the world's country, state and city dataset?

We find difficult to get this dataset on the interent. Many asked us to pay them the fee or take subscription fee etc., but I came through this blog where this person Rohit kumar from <a href="www.iamrohit.in">iamrohit.in</a> provided this very easily.

For a quick look what does this dataset look like. Here are some rows:

<table>
  <thead>
    <td>City</td>
    <td>State</td>
    <td>Country</td>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>Bombuflat</td>
    <td>Andaman and Nicobar Islands</td>
    <td>India</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Garacharma</td>
    <td>Andaman and Nicobar Islands</td>
    <td>India</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Port Blair</td>
    <td>Andaman and Nicobar Islands</td>
    <td>India</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rangat</td>
    <td>Andaman and Nicobar Islands</td>
    <td>India</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Addanki</td>
    <td>Andhra Pradesh</td>
    <td>India</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
 
 This dataset contains information of 47577 rows which is up to date. If you find anything out-dated, just inform him.
 
If you are in need of this dataset just check this link - <a>http://www.iamrohit.in/countries-states-and-cities-database-of-world-in-mysql/</a> and subscribe to his website. You can download it easily.

I might put up the downloaded file here but I don't want to discourage him. (Because I know how difficult it to get that file). This repo is just a reference for me and anybody who is in need of this.
